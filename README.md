# BasicRecon-v1

This script performs several common reconnaissance steps, including DNS enumeration, WHOIS lookup, HTTP enumeration, subdomain extraction, directory scanning, and subdomain takeover checks. It relies on tools like dnsrecon, whois, nmap, sublist3r, gobuster, and subjack to accomplish these tasks. You may need to install these tools and their dependencies before running the script.
